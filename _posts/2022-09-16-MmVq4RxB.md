Many docker images provide stripped down versions of ps that have
almost no options.  Normally, it truncates the output to the size of
the terminal. Have you ever wondered how to see the entirety of a long
command?

The answer is simple: convince ps that you aren't using a tty and
then it won't truncate:

```
:; ps | cat
```

When you pipe it to cat, ps doesn't think that it's attached to a tty
and so there is no truncation.  This trick works for many other commands
in different ways, e.g. if you pipe ls to cat, then it only gives you
a single column.
