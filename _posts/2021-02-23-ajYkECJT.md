If you use a prompt which begins with a colon and ends with a semi-colon,
you can cut and paste entire lines which requires much less eye-hand
co-ordination.

Consider, if you will, setting a prompt like this:

```
$ export PS1=": $(hostname -s); "
: chekalahk; ls
file1
file2
```

As : is a builtin /bin/sh command which returns true ignoring its
arguments, if you cut and paste the line:

```
: chekalahk; ls
```

Will evaluate into a NOOP and then the command that you typed in.

For root, you want to have a different prompt, generally one that
contains a hash for some reason.  The trick here is to make sure
that you position the hash s.t.:

    1. the hash is part of the preceding word, i.e. no spaces, and
    2. the semi-colon comes after the hash.

Like this:

```
: chekalahk#; ls
file
file
file
```
