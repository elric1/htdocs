If you use a prompt which begins with a colon and ends with a semi-colon,
you can cut and paste entire lines which requires much less eye-hand
co-ordination.

Consider, if you will, setting a prompt like this:

```
$ export PS1=": $(hostname -s); "
: chekalahk; ls
file1
file2
```

As : is a builtin /bin/sh command which returns true ignoring its
arguments, if you cut and paste the line:

```
: chekalahk; ls
```

Will evaluate into a NOOP and then the command that you typed in.
