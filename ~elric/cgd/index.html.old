<h1>The CryptoGraphic Disk Driver</h1>

<blockquote>
We present the design and implementation of CGD, the CryptoGraphic
Disk driver.  CGD is a pseudo-device driver that sits below the
buffer cache, and provides an encrypted view of an underlying raw
partition.  It was designed with high performance and ease of use
in mind.  CGD is aimed at laptops, other single-user computers or
removable storage, where protection from other concurrent users is
not essential, but protection against loss or theft is important.
