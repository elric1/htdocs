<h1>The CryptoGraphic Disk Driver</h1>

<blockquote>
We present the design and implementation of CGD, the CryptoGraphic
Disk driver.  CGD is a pseudo-device driver that sits below the
buffer cache, and provides an encrypted view of an underlying raw
partition.  It was designed with high performance and ease of use
in mind.  CGD is aimed at laptops, other single-user computers or
removable storage, where protection from other concurrent users is
not essential, but protection against loss or theft is important.

<h2>Random Conversation Topics</h2>

<h3>Choosing an IV method for CBC mode</h3>

Some concern has been expressed about using the encrypted block
number as the IV by various parties.  So, let's have a quick
discussion about what an IV actually is and what properties that
you want it to have:

<ol>
  <li>the IV is never repeated,</li>
  <li>the IV has most of the properties you expect of a
      cryptographically secure PRNG such as the hamming
      distance between IVs is high, etc., and
  </li>
  <li>if an attacker can choose chosen plaintext then they
      don't also know the IV while making the choice.
  </li>
</ol>

In general, the IV is transmitted in the clear along with the
ciphertext (e.g. in network protocols.) In this case, IVs are
pseudo-randomly generated.  For cryptographic disks, storing the
IV separately poses atomicity issues leaving us needing to either
deterministically create the IV for each sector or transactionally
store the IVs on the disk.  The latter has generally unacceptable
performance characteristics.
<p>

Choosing an incredibly strong IV does not affect the strength of
the final system terribly much.  Remember that in CBC mode, the IV
for each ciphertext block is the preceeding block.  So, if you
generate IVs that are more difficult to crack than the algorithm
that you are using to encrypt the ciphertext blocks then you had
better also store all of the data that you want to protect in the
first 128 bits of each sector!  Conversely choosing IVs that do
not have the above properties will adversely affect the resulting
system.

<p>
So, let's keep things in perspective.  And discuss a few alternatives:

<h4>Encrypted Block Number</h4>

A number of people have expressed some level of concern that CGD's
encrypted block number IV generation method uses the same key as
it does to encrypt the data.  Now, it is true that if you are
transmitting the IV in the clear as you would on e.g. a network
protocol then this poses a significant issue---but CGD does not
store the IV and so the attacker does not have access to it.  As
far as I know there aren't known exploits in this case.

<p>
It does satisfy the properties that I outlined above reasonably
obviously:

<ol>
  <li>As the encryption algorithm is a bijection and the block
      numbers are unique, we can assert that no IV shall be
      repeated on different blocks.  If you rewrite a block,
      you will end up re-using the same IV and so there is
      some level of structural analysis that might open up.
  </li>
  <li>The output of a block cipher on a sequence is a well
      recognised cryptographically secure PRNG, so we can
      assert that we have the required properties about
      hamming distance and all that.
  </li>
  <li>Given that for the attacker to be able to predict the
      IV for any particular block, he would need to more or
      less be able to crack the encryption algorithm, I think
      that we can assert that the IV will not be predictable
      to the attacker at at any point.  Unless it doesn't really
      matter anyway (that is the attacker has cracked the disk).
  </li>
</ol>

Now that said, it's unfortunate that the IV is constant under
different writes.

<h4>ESSIV</h4>

This method more or less uses an HMAC combined with the sector
number to generate the IV.

<p>
This seems to be a pretty reasonable way to go about things as
well.  The only thing that I prefer about encrypted block number
is that guarantees that the IVs are not repeated whereas ESSIV
doesn't.  But, that said, the statistical chance of a repeated IV
is so low that in practice it won't happen.

<p>
I have chosen to not implement ESSIV because I do not think that
it changes the security properties of the system much in the final
analysis.  I may implement it in the future, but only for compatibility
with other encrypted disks.

<h4>Plain Block Number</h4>

Well, this one rather obviously violates constraints (2) and (3).
And so it's vulnerable to watermark attacks.  That is, an attacker
can construct a file which if you save it on your disk will still
be obvious upon inspection of the ciphertext.  This is actually so
shockingly obvious that using the plain block number did not occur
to me when I was writing CGD.

<h3>An Initial Analysis of GBDE</h3>

GBDE (GEOM Based Disk Encryption) is an encrypted disk for FreeBSD
which was checked in a couple of weeks or so after I checked in
CGD.  So, they were developed mostly at the same time, although
neither I nor GBDE's author knew of the other's work.

<p>
Quite some time ago now, there was a relatively heated discussion
about CGD and GBDE and various properties that related to both in
which I participated.  At the time, I started writing a paper about
my perceived problems with GBDE.  At this point, the subject is no
longer relevant because it seems that GBDE has been replaced by
GELI (which is much better).  So, I've stopped writing the paper
and put up the work in progress for anyone who is interested:

<p>
If anyone is interested in finishing up all the combinatorics that
I didn't bother with, I'd be happy to work with you to complete
this.  But, again, I'm not really sure that it has continuing
relevance.
